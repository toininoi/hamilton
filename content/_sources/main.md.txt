Apache Hamilton (incubating) is a general-purpose framework to write dataflows using regular Python functions. At the core, each function defines a transformation and its parameters indicates its dependencies. Apache Hamilton automatically connects individual functions into a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) that can be executed, visualized, optimized, and reported on.
Apache Hamilton also comes with a [UI](hamilton-ui/index.rst) to visualize, catalog, and monitor your dataflows.

The ABC of Apache Hamilton
```

# Why should you use Apache Hamilton (incubating)?
**Facilitate collaboration**. By focusing on functions, Apache Hamilton avoids sprawling code hierarchy and generates flat dataflows. Well-scoped functions make it easier to add features, complete code reviews, debug pipeline failures, and hand-off projects. Visualizations can be generated directly from your code to better understand and document it.
Integration with the [Apache Hamilton UI](hamilton-ui/index.rst) allows you to track lineage, catalog code & artifacts, and monitor your dataflows.

**Reduce development time**. Apache Hamilton dataflows are reusable across projects and context (e.g., pipeline vs. web service). The benefits of developing robust and well-tested solutions are multiplied by reusability. Explore community-contributed dataflows in the [ecosystem](ecosystem/index.md).

**Own your platform**. Apache Hamilton helps you integrate the frameworks and tools of your stack. Apache Hamilton's features are easy to extend and customize to your needs. This flexibility enables self-serve designs and ultimately reduces the risks of vendor lock-in.

**Scale your dataflow**. Apache Hamilton separates transformation logic from execution, allowing you to seamlessly scale via remote execution (AWS, Modal, etc.) and specialized computation engines (Spark, Ray, duckdb etc.). Apache Hamilton was battle tested under intensive enterprise data workloads.

Here's a quick overview of benefits that Apache Hamilton provides as compared to other tools:

# Architecture Overview

The following diagram gives a simplified overview of the main components of Apache Hamilton.

![](./_static/architecture_overview.png)

**Functions & Module**. Transformations are regular Python functions organized into modules. Functions must be type-annotated, but hold no dependency with Apache Hamilton and can be reused outside of it.

**Driver & FunctionGraph**. The `Driver` will automatically assemble the `FunctionGraph` from the modules given. The `Driver` can be configured to modify and extend the execution behavior (e.g., remote execution, monitoring, webhooks, caching).

**Visualization**. The `FunctionGraph` can be visualized without executing code. This coupling ensures visualizations always match the code from modules.

**Execution**. When requesting variables, the `Driver` establishes an execution plan to only compute the required functions. Then, results are gathered and returned to the user.

                <p>"Apache Hamilton provides a modular and compatible framework that has significantly empowered our data science team. We've been able to build robust and flexible data pipelines with ease. The documentation is thorough and regularly updated... Even with no prior experience with the package, our team successfully migrated one of our legacy data pipelines to the Apache Hamilton structure within a month. This transition has greatly enhanced our productivity, enabling us to focus more on feature engineering and model iteration while Apache Hamilton's DAG approach seamlessly manages data lineage.<br/>I highly recommend Apache Hamilton to data professionals looking for a reliable, standardized solution for creating and managing data pipelines."</p>
